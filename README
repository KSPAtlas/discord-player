 discord-player
================

discord-player is a "client" (really, it's just a web browser) meant for Discord.

 Why?
======

Because the official client is proprietary and slow for me, and it does stuff on the
background that hogs my machine :(
I'd use Discord in my browser of choice, but it doesn't run correctly.

 How to build
==============

On Debian, discord-player depends on the following packages:

    qmake qtbase5-dev qt5-default qtwebengine5-dev

To build, just run:

    make

in this directory.
To install it globally at /usr/local you can simply run:

    make install

else, you can specify a prefix using:

    make PREFIX=your/prefix/here install


That is it, have fun! ;)

P.S.: I cannot write C++
